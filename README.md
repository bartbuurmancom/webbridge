#   Welcome to sixteenpixels' WebBridge!

WebBridge will allow you to communicate between
your webserver and your Minecraft-server!

You will be able to read a lot of information
from the running Minecraft-server at your
website and can also execute many predefined
commands.

WebBridge can be used through the (easy to use)
PHP-API or through the AJAX-interface(Javascript)

So all you need for using WebBridge is some
basic knowledge of PHP or Javscript.
